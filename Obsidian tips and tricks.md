# Obsidian tips and tricks

## Command pallet
Just type in `cmd + P` and type the command that you want to use. Next to it you will see the shortcut for the command you are using. See [[ReadMe#Hotkey]] how to add a Hotkey to it.

## Backlinks
To create a backlink to, for example, the Axual file, just use the double block brackets: [[Axual]]. This creates a backlink. A backlink is a link from and to a file. So this file is now linked to the Axual file and the Axual file is linked to this file. 

## Hotkey
go to `settings` -> `hotkeys` you can search for the action that you want and give it a hotkey.

## Graph view
To get the most out of obsidian, use the backlinks and then use the local graph view to see what is all linked to this file. (use the command pallet and search for 'open local graph'). It is easy to set a [[ReadMe#Hotkey]]

## Templates
It is very easy to use templates. But you need to enable this setting. Just go to `settings` -> `core plugins` -> `Templates` and enable it. It is easy to set a [[ReadMe#Hotkey]]

Also make sure you set the templates directory correct. Go to `Templates` (under plugin options) -> Set `Template folder location` to `Templates`
