# A second brain,  
for you, forever.

Obsidian is a powerful and extensible knowledge base  
that works on top of your local folder of plain text files.

# Everything is connected

The human brain is non-linear: we jump from idea to idea, all the time. Your second brain should work the same.

In Obsidian, making and following **connections** is frictionless. Tend to your notes like a gardener; at the end of the day, sit back and marvel at your own knowledge graph.

# Extensively extensible

Note-taking is incredibly **personal**. Tried every app, but something always irks you? You deserve better.

For those who can't custom-build a solution for themselves, Obsidian is as close as you can get, with plugins, themes, and custom CSS at your disposal.

# Notes for your grandchildren

In our age when cloud services can [shut](https://techcrunch.com/2013/07/31/evernote-competitor-catch-com-shuts-down-its-note-taking-apps-company-heading-in-different-direction/) [down](https://www.theverge.com/2014/5/22/5741602/one-time-evernote-pinterest-rival-springpad-to-close-its-doors), [get](https://gadgets.ndtv.com/apps/news/microsoft-to-do-new-features-wunderlist-shuts-down-2224833) [bought](https://www.theverge.com/2012/3/12/2865638/twitter-acquires-posterous-blogging-platform), or [change privacy policy](https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/14/evernotes-new-privacy-policy-allows-employees-to-read-your-notes/) any day, the last thing you want is proprietary format and data lock-in.

With Obsidian, **your data sits in a local folder**. Never leave your life's work held hostage in the cloud again.
