The acronym OKR stands for Objectives and Key Results, a popular goal management framework that helps companies implement and execute strategy. The benefits of the framework include a better focus on results that matter, increased transparency, and better (strategic) alignment. OKR achieves this by organizing employees and the work they do around achieving common Objectives.

An OKR consists of an **Objective**, which tells you where to go, and several **Key Results**, which are the results you need to achieve to get to your Objective. **Initiatives** are all the projects and tasks that will help you achieve your Key Results.

The framework includes a number of rules which help employees prioritize, align, and measure the outcome of their efforts. OKR helps companies bridge the gap between strategy and execution and move from an output- to an outcome-based approach to work.
